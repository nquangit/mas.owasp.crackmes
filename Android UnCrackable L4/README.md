# Android UnCrackable L4

The Radare2 community always dreamed with its decentralized and free currency to allow r2 fans to make payments in places and transfer money between r2 users. A debug version of the r2Pay app has been developed and it will be supported very soon in many stores and websites. Can you verify that this is cryptographically unbreakable?

Hint: Run the APK in a non-tampered device to play a bit with the app.

    There is a master PIN code that generates green tokens (aka r2coins) on the screen. If you see a red r2coin, then this token won't be validated by the community. You need to find out the 4 digits PIN code and the salt employed as well. Flag: r2con{PIN_NUMERIC:SALT_LOWERCASE}
    There is a "r2pay master key" buried in layers of obfuscation and protections. Can you break the whitebox? Flag: r2con{ascii(key)}
